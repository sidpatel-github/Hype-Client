# Hype-Client

In today’s world publicity is important for any company to aware of its product to people. Many agencies provide a platform to a user for
"outdoor advertisement". But the user needs to talk to this agency face to face. So, this project is going to make this traditional approach 
more user friendly by providing an android application so that the user doesn’t need to approach an agency face-to-face. 

HYPE provides the User-friendly and ease environment for online order the banner, which will be further deployed at a specific location
in the city. The clients didn’t need to visit different publicity agency for inquiring about hoarding and its details, for publishing 
their product or their organization in the city. The client can online choose the banner that he wants to publish. The client can also
send a photograph of sample banner which he wants to publish to the admin. It provides notification facility to the client, about the
various stages of his banner i.e. in a queue, verification, accepted, rejected, fixed etc..The client can also give the feedback about
the service to the publicity agency. After the completion of work, an e-mail is automatically sent to an intended user so that the user 
can able to know about the completion of work.
